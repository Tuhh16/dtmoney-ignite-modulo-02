## 💻 About the project

<p>The project is a financial control application where we can record income and expenses in our account. The dashboard displays the total income, expenses, and the current account balance, along with a transaction history.</p>
<p>To develop this application, we used some libraries such as styled-components and for handling all the logic, we utilized React's Context API.</p>
<p>Finally, we employed Mirage JS to create a test API where we can register and list all transactions.</p>
